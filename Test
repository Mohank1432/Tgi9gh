The architecture is built on a hybrid model combining a cloud-native SaaS service with an on-premises connector, ensuring that sensitive credentials remain within the customer’s secure environment while leveraging the cloud for orchestration.
3.1 Architectural Components
Component
Description
Deployment Location
Remote Access Cloud Service
The SaaS orchestration layer managing tenant activation, vendor invitations, and the authentication handshake. No credentials or biometrics are stored here.
CyberArk AWS Cloud (Regional)
CyberArk Mobile App
Acts as the biometric authenticator. It scans QR codes from the web portal and uses the device’s secure enclave (FaceID/Fingerprint) to sign cryptographic challenges.
User’s Smartphone (iOS/Android)
Remote Access Connector
A lightweight container (Docker/Podman) that bridges the SaaS service and the internal network. It requires no inbound ports, using only an outbound tunnel over port 443.
Customer On-Premises / Private Cloud (Linux Host)
HTML5 Gateway
Translates RDP and SSH sessions into HTTPS. This ensures protocol isolation, preventing malware or direct network connections from the remote endpoint.
Customer On-Premises (often co-hosted with Connector)
CyberArk PAM / Privilege Cloud
The core vaulting service that manages credentials, rotates passwords, and records sessions.
On-Premises or SaaS
3.2 Connectivity Flow




Phase 1: Onboarding (Getting the Vendor Ready)
• Step 1 & 2: Invitation: An internal administrator sends an invite to the vendor's email address. They define a specific timeframe (e.g., "Access allowed only on Monday, 9 AM - 5 PM").
• Step 3: Registration: The vendor downloads the CyberArk Mobile App. They register using their phone number and their device's native biometrics (FaceID or Fingerprint). This binds their physical identity to their digital access rights.
Phase 2: Authentication (Proving Identity)
• Step 4 & 5: The Portal: The vendor opens a standard web browser (Chrome, Edge, etc.) and navigates to the Remote Access portal. A unique, time-sensitive QR code appears on the screen.
• Step 6 & 7: Biometric Handshake: The vendor scans the QR code with their mobile app. The app asks for a fingerprint or face scan. Once validated, the app sends a cryptographic token to the Cloud Service. Crucially, no passwords are typed, and no biometric data leaves the phone.
Phase 3: The Secure Connection (Crossing the Perimeter)
• Step 8: The Reverse Tunnel: This is the core security mechanism. The Remote Access Connector (sitting inside the company network) keeps a constant outbound connection open to the Cloud Service over port 443. When the vendor logs in, the Cloud Service uses this pre-existing tunnel to send traffic back in. This means the company does not need to open any inbound firewall ports.
• Step 9: Just-in-Time (JIT) Provisioning: Once authenticated, the system automatically creates a temporary user in the internal Vault. This user exists only for this session. When the vendor logs off, the user is deleted. This ensures "Zero Standing Privileges" (no dormant accounts waiting to be hacked).
Phase 4: The Isolated Session (Doing the Work)
• Step 10 & 11: Protocol Translation: The vendor is not connected directly to the internal server. Instead, the HTML5 Gateway translates the internal RDP (Windows) or SSH (Linux) session into a secure webpage stream. The vendor sees the server screen in their browser, but malware cannot jump from their laptop to the company server.
• Step 12: Audit & Monitoring: Because the session flows through CyberArk, every keystroke and mouse click is recorded. Security teams can watch the session live or review the video later for compliance (e.g., SOC 2 audit).



KB Article: Vendor Guide to Accessing Systems via CyberArk Remote Access
Overview
Our organization uses CyberArk Remote Access to provide you with secure connection to internal applications. Unlike traditional VPNs, this solution does not require you to install a VPN client on your laptop, nor does it require you to manage a static password.
Instead, you will authenticate using the CyberArk Mobile App on your smartphone, leveraging your device's biometrics (FaceID or Fingerprint) for a passwordless, high-security login experience.
Prerequisites
Before initiating access, ensure you have the following:
1. A Smartphone: An iOS or Android device with a working camera.
2. Biometrics Enabled: Your phone must have FaceID (iOS) or Fingerprint/Biometric authentication enabled and configured.
3. Internet Connectivity: Both your workstation and mobile device require internet access for the initial setup.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Part 1: Registration and Onboarding
You will receive an invitation email to join our secure tenant. Follow these steps to register your identity.
1. Locate the Invitation Email: Check your inbox for an email from CyberArk Remote Access (formerly Alero).
    ◦ Note: If you do not see it, check your Spam/Junk folder.
2. Download the App: The email will contain links to download the CyberArk Mobile app from the Apple App Store or Google Play Store. Install this application on your smartphone.
3. Register Your Biometrics:
    ◦ Open the app.
    ◦ Enter your mobile phone number.
    ◦ You will receive an SMS verification code. Enter this code into the app.
    ◦ The app will prompt you to authenticate using your phone’s biometrics (FaceID or Fingerprint). This binds your physical identity to your access rights.
4. Accept the Invite: Return to the email on your computer or phone and click the activation link. This will finalize your registration with our tenant.
Privacy Note: Your biometric data (face or fingerprint) remains encrypted in your phone’s secure storage. It is never transmitted to the cloud or stored by our organization.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Part 2: Logging In (Daily Usage)
Once registered, you can access shared resources using the QR code login flow.
1. Navigate to the Portal: Open your web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, or Safari) and go to the Remote Access portal URL provided in your invitation (e.g., https://portal.alero.io or https://portal.alero.eu depending on your region).
2. Scan the QR Code:
    ◦ The web page will display a unique QR code.
    ◦ Open the CyberArk Mobile App on your phone.
    ◦ Tap the camera icon/scan button within the app.
    ◦ Point your phone at the computer screen to scan the QR code.
3. Biometric Approval:
    ◦ Immediately after scanning, the app will ask for biometric verification.
    ◦ Use your FaceID or Fingerprint to confirm.

Troubleshooting & FAQ
Q: What if I don't have internet access on my phone? A: The CyberArk Mobile App supports Offline Access. If your phone has no signal, you can still open the app to generate a time-based one-time code to access credentials or secure notes that have been cached on the device.
Q: The QR code expired before I scanned it. A: The QR codes are time-sensitive for security. simply refresh your web browser to generate a new code. Ensure your phone's time settings are set to "Automatic" to prevent synchronization errors.
Q: Can I use a different authenticator app (like Google Authenticator)? A: No. You must use the CyberArk Mobile App because it utilizes specific cryptographic keys and biometric validation required by our Zero Trust policy.
Q: Why was my session disconnected? A: Access is granted on a "Just-in-Time" basis. If your authorized time window (e.g., 9:00 AM - 5:00 PM) has ended, your access is automatically revoked and active sessions may be terminated. Contact your project lead if you require an extension.
