To ensure this document is 100% comprehensive, I have added several critical "advanced" features that CyberArk Remote Access offers, which were not in the previous draft. These include Just-in-Time (JIT) Provisioning, Offline Access, Secure Native Access, and Phone/Email Token fallback.
CyberArk Remote Access: The Complete Design & Capability Document
1. High-Level Design & Architecture
CyberArk Remote Access is a SaaS solution designed to provide secure, agentless, and passwordless access to internal privileged systems.
Architectural Components
 * Remote Access Cloud (SaaS): A multi-tenant AWS-hosted service (across 3 Availability Zones) that orchestrates authentication and user management.
 * Remote Access Connector: A Docker-based Linux component installed internally. It initiates an outbound-only TLS 443 connection to the Cloud.
 * HTML5 Gateway: Often integrated with the Connector to provide a clientless RDP/SSH experience directly in the web browser.
 * CyberArk Mobile App: Acts as the identity provider using biometric-to-SAML technology.
2. Core Capabilities & Service Offerings
Beyond simple login, CyberArk Remote Access includes:
 * Just-in-Time (JIT) Provisioning: Automatically creates a temporary user in the CyberArk Vault when a vendor logs in, and removes them when they log out. No need for permanent accounts in Active Directory.
 * Secure Native Access: Allows users to use their native tools (like PuTTY or MTSC) to connect via the Remote Access tunnel, rather than being forced to use a web browser.
 * Zero Standing Privileges (ZSP): Ensures vendors have no access until the moment they authenticate biometrically.
 * Offline Access: Enables users to access specific vaulted credentials even if the Remote Access Cloud service is temporarily unavailable.
3. Prerequisites & Requirements
Administrator / Infrastructure
 * Connector Server: Linux (Ubuntu/RHEL/CentOS) with Docker and snapd installed.
 * Network: Outbound 443 access to *.alero.io (or regional equivalent like *.alero.eu).
 * PAM Integration: PVWA v10.4+ and Vault v10.4+.
Vendor / End-User
 * Smartphone: Biometric-enabled (FaceID, TouchID, or Android Biometrics).
 * Fallback MFA: If biometrics are not used, a valid phone number for SMS or an email for one-time tokens.
4. Detailed User Flows
A. Onboarding & Invitation Flow
 * Invite: Admin sends a link or email.
 * App Registration: User registers their phone number on the CyberArk Mobile App.
 * Tenant Bond: User scans a "Join Tenant" QR code.
 * JIT Creation: Upon first login, Remote Access communicates with the Vault to create a "Shadow User" for that vendor.
B. Login: With CyberArk Mobile App (Primary)
 * Navigate to the portal → Scan QR Code via Mobile App.
 * Confirm identity via Biometrics on the phone.
 * Session is established; user is redirected to the PAM dashboard.
C. Login: Without Mobile App (Fallback/Token)
Used if a user cannot use the app or is an internal employee.
 * Email/SMS Token: User enters their registered email/phone.
 * One-Time Password (OTP): User receives a code and enters it on the workstation.
 * Identity Provider (SAML): Employees can bypass the app by authenticating through their corporate IdP (Azure AD/Okta).
D. Login: Secure Native Access Flow
 * User opens their native RDP/SSH client.
 * They point the client to a specific Remote Access string/address.
 * The user receives a push notification on their CyberArk Mobile App to "Approve" the session.
 * Once approved, the session launches natively on their desktop.
5. Logging & Audit Flow
CyberArk provides a "Single Pane of Glass" for auditing:
 * Identity Logs: SaaS portal tracks who logged in and how (biometrics vs. token).
 * Network Logs: Connector tracks the duration of the secure tunnel.
 * Activity Logs: PVWA/Vault tracks which accounts were accessed.
 * Video Logs: PSM captures a full video recording of everything the vendor did during the session.

This document is a comprehensive technical guide for CyberArk Remote Access (formerly Alero), covering every phase from architectural design to granular user flows.
1. High-Level Design & Architecture
CyberArk Remote Access is a SaaS-based solution that enables Zero Trust access to privileged resources without VPNs or passwords.
Architectural Layers
 * Remote Access Cloud (SaaS): The orchestration engine. It manages identities, serves the web portal, and processes biometric authentication requests. It is hosted in high-availability AWS regions (US, EU, AU, etc.).
 * The Connector (On-Prem/VPC): A hardened Linux-based Docker container installed inside your network. It establishes an outbound-only TLS 443 connection to the SaaS cloud.
   * Role: Acts as a secure proxy between the cloud and internal PAM components (PVWA, PSM, Vault).
 * HTML5 Gateway: An optional but recommended component (often bundled with the Connector) that allows RDP and SSH sessions to run entirely within a web browser without requiring local clients.
 * CyberArk Mobile App: The "Identity Provider." It uses the smartphone’s secure enclave for biometric verification and generates encrypted tokens for login.
2. Prerequisites for Sending Vendor Invitations
Before an admin can send an invitation, the following must be verified:
Infrastructure Setup
 * Connector Status: Must be "Active" in the Remote Access Portal.
 * Internal Connectivity: The Connector must have a network path to the PVWA (via HTTPS) and PSM (via RDP/SSH).
 * Group Mapping: You must have pre-defined Remote Access Groups that map to specific CyberArk Safes in your Vault.
 * Regional URLs: Ensure your firewall allows outbound access to your specific data center (e.g., *.alero.io for US, *.alero.eu for Europe).
Vendor Data Requirements
 * Email Address: A unique email for the invitation.
 * Phone Number: Required for initial registration and SMS verification.
 * Biometric Smartphone: The vendor must have a device (iOS 10+ or Android 6.0+) with FaceID, TouchID, or Fingerprint sensors.
3. Vendor Onboarding Flow (Detailed Steps)
 * Invitation: Admin logs into portal.alero.io, enters the vendor’s email, selects a Remote Access Group, and sets an Access Expiration date.
 * App Setup: The vendor receives an email, clicks the link, and downloads the CyberArk Mobile App.
 * Registration:
   * The vendor enters their phone number in the app.
   * They receive and enter a 6-digit SMS verification code.
   * They set up a PIN and record their biometrics (Face/Fingerprint).
 * Bonding: The vendor scans the Invitation QR Code (from their email/PC) using the app. This securely links their identity to your tenant.
 * Selfie (Optional): If configured, the vendor takes a photo for identity verification by the Admin.
4. Authentication & Login Flows
A. Login with CyberArk Mobile App (Primary)
 * Request: User goes to the company’s Remote Access URL. A dynamic QR code appears.
 * Scan: User opens the mobile app and scans the QR code.
 * Biometric Match: The phone prompts for FaceID/Fingerprint.
 * SAML Exchange: Upon success, the app communicates with the Cloud to generate a short-lived SAML token.
 * Entry: The browser refreshes, and the user is logged into the PVWA automatically.
B. Login without Mobile App (SAML/IdP Fallback)
Typically for internal employees using corporate laptops.
 * IdP Redirect: User selects "Login with Corporate Credentials."
 * Corporate Login: User is redirected to Azure AD, Okta, or Ping.
 * MFA: User authenticates via corporate MFA (e.g., Microsoft Authenticator or a hardware key).
 * Access: The IdP sends a claim back to CyberArk Remote Access, which grants entry based on group membership.
5. Advanced Capabilities: JIT & Native Access
Just-In-Time (JIT) Provisioning Flow
 * Step 1: The vendor logs in via the app.
 * Step 2: Remote Access sends an API command to the Vault to create an ephemeral "Shadow User."
 * Step 3: The user is added to the necessary Vault Groups for the duration of their session.
 * Step 4: Upon logout or session timeout, the user is removed/deleted from the Vault, ensuring Zero Standing Privileges.
Secure Native Access Flow
 * Allows users to use PuTTY, WinSCP, or MTSC without the browser.
 * Step 1: User initiates a connection via their native tool using a specific string (e.g., user#target@company.alero.io).
 * Step 2: A Push Notification is sent to the CyberArk Mobile App.
 * Step 3: User approves biometrically on their phone.
 * Step 4: The session is tunneled through the Connector to the internal target.
6. User Logging & Audit Flow
| Log Source | Description |
|---|---|
| Identity Audit | SaaS portal logs the exact time, location, and device used for biometric login. |
| Connector Logs | Records the initiation of the secure tunnel and which internal URLs were accessed. |
| Vault Audit | Logs every time a user "Uses" or "Retrieves" a password through the portal. |
| PSM Recording | A full video and text-searchable transcript of the RDP/SSH session is stored in the Vault. |
