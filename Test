Phase 1: Onboarding (Getting the Vendor Ready)
• Step 1 & 2: Invitation: An internal administrator sends an invite to the vendor's email address. They define a specific timeframe (e.g., "Access allowed only on Monday, 9 AM - 5 PM").
• Step 3: Registration: The vendor downloads the CyberArk Mobile App. They register using their phone number and their device's native biometrics (FaceID or Fingerprint). This binds their physical identity to their digital access rights.
Phase 2: Authentication (Proving Identity)
• Step 4 & 5: The Portal: The vendor opens a standard web browser (Chrome, Edge, etc.) and navigates to the Remote Access portal. A unique, time-sensitive QR code appears on the screen.
• Step 6 & 7: Biometric Handshake: The vendor scans the QR code with their mobile app. The app asks for a fingerprint or face scan. Once validated, the app sends a cryptographic token to the Cloud Service. Crucially, no passwords are typed, and no biometric data leaves the phone.
Phase 3: The Secure Connection (Crossing the Perimeter)
• Step 8: The Reverse Tunnel: This is the core security mechanism. The Remote Access Connector (sitting inside the company network) keeps a constant outbound connection open to the Cloud Service over port 443. When the vendor logs in, the Cloud Service uses this pre-existing tunnel to send traffic back in. This means the company does not need to open any inbound firewall ports.
• Step 9: Just-in-Time (JIT) Provisioning: Once authenticated, the system automatically creates a temporary user in the internal Vault. This user exists only for this session. When the vendor logs off, the user is deleted. This ensures "Zero Standing Privileges" (no dormant accounts waiting to be hacked).
Phase 4: The Isolated Session (Doing the Work)
• Step 10 & 11: Protocol Translation: The vendor is not connected directly to the internal server. Instead, the HTML5 Gateway translates the internal RDP (Windows) or SSH (Linux) session into a secure webpage stream. The vendor sees the server screen in their browser, but malware cannot jump from their laptop to the company server.
• Step 12: Audit & Monitoring: Because the session flows through CyberArk, every keystroke and mouse click is recorded. Security teams can watch the session live or review the video later for compliance (e.g., SOC 2 audit).
